# Let the magic begin
It's my starter web developing template repo. Just clone or import the repo link `https://github.com/thatonenerd2000/Starter-Template.git` to make a copy.

Please keep in mind that the initial index.html is only linked to a stylesheet, animate css cdn, a script file and both bootstrap css and js file. There are more frameworks and plugins available in the js and css folder.
